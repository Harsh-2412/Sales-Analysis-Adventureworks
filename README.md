# Sales-Analysis-Adventureworks

Hi I am Harsh, An aspiring Data Analyst. This is my Project for Sales analysis On Adventure works ( A Bike Company). 
The goal of the project is to improve internet sales reporting by transitioning from static reports to visual dashboards.
The focus of the dashboards is on tracking product sales, customer information and performance over time.
It should allow filtering of data by Sales, product, and customer.
The budget has been included in a spreadsheet for comparison with sales numbers. The analysis of sales typically involves looking back two years in time.
